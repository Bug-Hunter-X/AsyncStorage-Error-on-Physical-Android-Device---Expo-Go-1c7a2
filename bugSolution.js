The solution involves verifying necessary permissions and potentially using a more robust storage mechanism.

```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';

const storeData = async (key, value) => {
  try {
    const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.STORAGE);
    if (status !== 'granted') {
      console.error('Storage permission denied');
      return;
    }
    await AsyncStorage.setItem(key, value);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('Failed to store data:', e);
    // Consider alternative storage if AsyncStorage consistently fails
  }
};

// Example usage:
storeData('myKey', 'myValue');
```

This improved solution explicitly requests the necessary storage permissions before attempting to use AsyncStorage.  If permission is not granted, it logs an error message.  The use of a try...catch block helps manage any exceptions that may arise during storage operations.  For consistently problematic scenarios, consider investigating alternative storage options, such as SQLite or MMKV.
