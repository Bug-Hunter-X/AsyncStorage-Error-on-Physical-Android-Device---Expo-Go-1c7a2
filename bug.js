This bug occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses AsyncStorage.  The app runs fine in the Expo Go app on an Android emulator, but when built and installed on a physical Android device, AsyncStorage throws an error that it cannot access the storage.

```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const storeData = async (key, value) => {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem(key, value)
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('Failed to store data:', e)
  }
}
```

The error message usually points to a permission issue or a problem with the AsyncStorage implementation.
